<h1>Homework 7: Proportional Symbol Map </h1>
<h2>James Hoglund</h2>
<h3>This is a proportional symbol map of earthquakes in California in 2022. As shown in the legend, 
    each dot represents an earthquake in California in 2022, and the size of the dot is proportional to
    its magnitude. I chose this dataset to make a map because the topic intrigued me. Everyone knows
    that California is prone to earthquakes, but the sheer number of them in the past year really surprised me.
