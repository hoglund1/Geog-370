<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>James Hoglund</h2>
<h3>For this map, I imported 2 shapefiles: one with all the hazardous waste sites in North Carolina, and the other with all the public water supply sources in the state. I then put a 2 mile buffer around the two shapefiles, and the intersected the two to see the overlap. I was curious how close drinking water supplies came to hazardous waste sites, and with this map, I answered that question.</h3>
